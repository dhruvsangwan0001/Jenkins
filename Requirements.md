SIT223/SIT753 
High Distinction Task: 
DevOps Pipeline with Jenkins 
Professional Practice in IT 
Overview 
In this task, you will create a DevOps pipeline for your own project or code using Jenkins to 
ensure that your code is built, tested, and deployed in a reliable and consistent manner. The 
pipeline will include automated testing, code quality analysis, and deployment. Continuous 
delivery and deployment tools will be used to ensure that changes are automatically 
deployed to test and production environments, while monitoring and alerting tools will be 
included to ensure that any issues are quickly identified and addressed. 
Assessment Instructions 
HD grades are awarded based on the number and quality of pipeline stages you successfully 
implement from steps 4-10 (Build, Test, Code Quality, Security, Deploy, Release, 
Monitoring). The table below shows the minimum stage requirements for each HD band: 
 80-85% Low HD: Minimum 4 stages successfully implemented 
 86-90% Mid HD: 5-6 stages implemented and functioning correctly   
 91-95% High HD: All 7 stages implemented with only minor integration issues 
 96-100% Top HD: All 7 stages with full automation and smooth transitions between 
stages 
Within each eligible HD band, the rubric (Appendix II) assesses execution quality across all 
criteria to determine your exact score. 
1. Choose a project of your choice. This could be your Capstone project or previous 
projects, such as a web application or mobile application (Please see Appendix I). 
2. Create a Git repository for your project and push your code to the repository. 
3. Create a Jenkins pipeline for your project with all stages: Build, Test, Code Quality, 
Security, Deploy, Release, and Monitoring.  
4. In the Build stage, configure Jenkins to build your code and create a build artefact. 
This could be a JAR file, Docker image, or any other artefact that can be used to 
deploy your application. 
5. In the Test stage, configure Jenkins to run automated tests on your code. You can 
choose any testing framework of your choice, such as JUnit, Selenium, or Appium, to 
test your application in the test environment to ensure that the deployment was 
successful, and that the application is working correctly. 
6. Configure Jenkins to run code quality analysis on your code. This focuses on the 
structure, style, and maintainability of your codebase. You can choose tools such as 
SonarQube or CodeClimate and configure them to automatically detect issues such 
as code duplication, code smells, and poor complexity or design patterns.  
Note: While some tools (e.g., SonarQube) may optionally report basic security
related issues, this stage is mainly concerned with code health, NOT in-depth security 
scanning. 
Professional Practice in IT 
7. In the Security stage, configure Jenkins to perform automated security analysis on 
your codebase or dependencies. This ensures that vulnerabilities are detected and 
addressed early in the CI/CD pipeline. If vulnerabilities are found, you must briefly 
explain: 
 What the issue is. 
 Its severity. 
 Whether and how you addressed it (e.g., updating a library, excluding false 
positives). 
Tip: 
 Think of Code Quality as improving how your code looks and works for 
developers. 
 Think of Security as protecting your app and users from hackers. 
8. In the Deploy stage, configure Jenkins to deploy your application to a test 
environment, such as a staging server or a Docker container. You can use any 
deployment tool of your choice, such as Docker Compose or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 
9. In the Release stage, configure Jenkins to promote the application to a production 
environment. You can use any release management tool of your choice, such as 
Octopus Deploy or AWS CodeDeploy. 
10. In the Monitoring and Alerting stage, configure Jenkins to integrate with a 
monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog or New Relic) to monitor the production application 
and automatically alert the team when issues occur. 
Submission Guidelines 
 Create a demo video that showcases your pipeline in action. The video should be no 
longer than 10 minutes and should demonstrate the following: - 
How to clone the repository and set up the pipeline in Jenkins. - - 
How the pipeline works and progresses through each stage. 
The final deployed application and any additional features you wish to showcase. 
 Submit a PDF document that includes the following, using the provided template: - 
A link to the demo video. - - - - - 
A link to your GitHub repository containing the Jenkins pipeline script. Please 
ensure that BOTH your Marker AND the Unit Chair have been granted 
appropriate access permissions to view the codebase.   
Specify how many stages you have implemented. 
A brief description of your project and the technologies used. 
A screenshot of your Jenkins pipeline. 
A brief description of each stage of your pipeline, including the frameworks/tools 
used. 
See Critical Note and Appendices I and II on the next pages.

Appendix I - Some Notes on How to Choose a Suitable Project for Your Jenkins 
DevOps Pipeline 
 
1. Choose a Project with Functional Depth 
 Your project should include multiple features or components (e.g. user authentication, 
CRUD operations, or API endpoints).  
 It should be more than just static content — ideally, it should involve back-end logic, 
services, or interactions that can be built, tested, deployed, and monitored. 
 
2. The Codebase Should Support Automation 
 Use a tech stack that can be easily integrated into Jenkins (e.g. Node.js, Java, Python, 
Docker). 
 Ensure it has a build process (e.g. npm run build, mvn package, or docker build). 
 The codebase should support tools such as: 
 SonarQube or CodeClimate for code quality 
 Snyk, Trivy, or Bandit for security scanning 
 Docker, AWS, or Heroku for deployment 
 
3. Testing Should Be Possible 
 Include logic or modules that can be tested with unit or integration testing frameworks (e.g. 
JUnit, Jest, Mocha, or Postman for API testing). 
 Avoid projects that consist only of static HTML/CSS or simple front-end demos lacking 
testable logic. 
 
4. Ensure It Can Be Deployed 
 The project should run as a deployable app or service such as a web app, mobile API back
end, or microservice. 
 If using containers, ensure you have a working Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml. 
 
5. Support Monitoring (For High HD) 
 Your project should expose logs, endpoints, or performance metrics that can be monitored.  
 Choose something that can be run in a container or VM where tools like Prometheus, New 
Relic, or Datadog can track usage or failures.  
Critical Note: 
 
 7.3HD allows 2 submissions total (initial submission → feedback → 1 resubmission).  
 
 After your first submission receives feedback, revise and make your final 
resubmission. No further submissions allowed.  
 
 Final status will be marked Complete, Feedback Exceeded, or Time Exceeded based 
on submission timing.  
 
 Don't forget to ensure your marker and unit chair have access to these files, so you 
are not wasting the only feedback opportunity you will get.
